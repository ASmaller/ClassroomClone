# ClassroomClone
This Google Apps Script clones all the material in every class you are in and adds it to your Google Drive, the commented code also clones your work.

Make sure to:
Add Google Classroom API in your project services.
Rename the "\*\*\*FOLDER NAME\*\*\*" to your own folder's name.
You might need to change variable start on line 11 and run it again. (The last classrooms index will be printed shortly before the program crashes, replace the i with this index.)
